# Whether to tell LMDB to use POSIX semaphores during compilation
# (instead of the default, which are System V semaphores).
# POSIX semaphores are required for Apple's App Sandbox on iOS & macOS,
# and are possibly faster and more appropriate for single-process use.
# There are tradeoffs for both POSIX and SysV semaphores; which you
# should look into before enabling this feature. Also, see here:
